You will learn about: \n\n● Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs \n\n● Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on",
